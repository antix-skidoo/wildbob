wildbob (0.84.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * removed debian+ubuntu patches
  * removed Recommends: zenity
  * removed Recommends: dwww
  * added Depends: gksu
  * removed "apport" from debian/install, and associated python script
    (apport intercepts program crashes, collects debugging information
     about the operating system environment, and sends it to bug trackers
     in a standardized form.)
  * remove WINGS -related files
  * remove "Lock" (aka pkg hold) functionality. This feature held only
      experimental status. Use of apt-mark hold is recommended instead.
  * TODO:   heldM.xpm
